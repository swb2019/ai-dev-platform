# AI Dev Platform

**A secure, production-ready foundation for deploying AI-oriented applications to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot.**

The AI Dev Platform is a comprehensive monorepo that bundles a modern Next.js 14 application, shared TypeScript tooling, Terraform-based infrastructure, and automated CI/CD pipelines. It is designed with a security-first approach, integrating supply-chain scanning, binary authorization, and end-to-end validation to ensure robust and reliable deployments.

## Key Features

- **Modern web stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, and Tailwind CSS v4.
- **GKE Autopilot delivery:** Automated Kubernetes deployments via Kustomize and Gateway API routing.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** GCP infrastructure managed entirely by Terraform (GKE, networking, Workload Identity Federation, Artifact Registry).
- **Secure CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflows authenticate to GCP via Workload Identity Federation for keyless operations.
- **Supply-chain security:** Integrated scanning (Trivy, Grype), SBOM generation (Syft), and keyless signing (Cosign).
- **Binary Authorization:** Enforced in GKE so only signed and attested images are admitted.
- **Comprehensive testing:** Jest + Testing Library unit tests and Playwright E2E tests wired into the delivery pipeline.
- **Monorepo ergonomics:** PNPM workspaces and Turbo coordinate builds, tests, and shared tooling.
- **Security guardrails:** Gitleaks, Semgrep, CodeQL, and centralized ESLint rules (security + SonarJS) run locally and in CI.

## Architecture Overview

This platform leverages GKE Autopilot for managed Kubernetes, using the Gateway API for external traffic management. Infrastructure is composed with Terraform modules and applied per environment (staging and production). Deployments rely on Kustomize overlays that inject immutable image digests and Workload Identity bindings. GitHub Actions authenticates through Workload Identity Federation (WIF) to push signed images to Artifact Registry and apply manifests to GKE, where Binary Authorization enforces attestation policies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed and authenticated:

1. **Node.js 20.x** – enable Corepack and activate pnpm 9:
   ```bash
   corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9.12.0 --activate
   ```
2. **Docker** – required for local container builds and scanning.
3. **CLIs** – Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`), Terraform CLI, and GitHub CLI (`gh`) with access to the target project.
4. **Playwright dependencies** – install browser dependencies once locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @ai-dev-platform/web exec playwright install --with-deps
   ```

### Setup

**Windows quick start**

- From an elevated PowerShell session in the repo root, run:
  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\setup.ps1 [-DockerInstallerPath C:\path\to\DockerDesktopInstaller.exe]
  ```
  This orchestrates WSL2 feature enablement, installs the Ubuntu distribution (prompting if first-run setup is needed), sets it as the default WSL distro, provisions Docker Desktop with WSL integration (via `winget`, direct download, or a supplied installer), clones the repository inside WSL, and executes `./scripts/setup-all.sh`. Re-run the command after following any prompts; completed stages are skipped automatically. Use `-RepoSlug your-user/ai-dev-platform` or `-Branch feature` to target a fork/branch, and pass `-DockerInstallerPath` or set `DOCKER_DESKTOP_INSTALLER` when operating in offline/proxy-restricted environments.

**Cross-platform scripts**

The provided scripts streamline the initial setup:

1. **One-shot setup**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-all.sh
   ```
   Runs prerequisite installation, onboarding, infrastructure bootstrap, repository hardening, editor extension management, _and_ automated verification (`docker info`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm --filter @ai-dev-platform/web test`). The wrapper provisions common OS packages (apt, dnf, Homebrew), installs Node/pnpm tooling, and verifies Docker availability. Each check has built-in recovery—`docker info` re-invokes the Docker setup helper, while PNPM commands trigger reinstall/fix routines before retrying. On WSL it can launch the Docker Desktop installer (via `winget` or direct download); finish any Windows prompts (or reboot if requested), relaunch Docker Desktop to enable WSL integration, then re-run the script until all checks succeed. Set `SKIP_POST_CHECKS=1` to bypass verification or `POST_CHECK_MAX_RETRIES=5` (for example) to allow additional automatic recovery attempts.

The script keeps a checkpoint file in `tmp/setup-all.state`, letting you stop and resume without repeating completed steps. On the next run it reports prior failures and skips finished stages automatically. To re-run everything from scratch, set `RESET_SETUP_STATE=1 ./scripts/setup-all.sh`.
Additional knobs:

- `POST_CHECK_MAX_RETRIES` – increase automated recovery attempts for post-checks (default `3`).
- `DOCKER_DESKTOP_INSTALLER` – absolute Windows path to a pre-downloaded Docker Desktop installer (used by the WSL helper when the network is locked down).
- Post-check logs are written to `tmp/postcheck-*.log` so you can review failures after automated recovery attempts.

2. **Bootstrap infrastructure (optional standalone)**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/bootstrap-infra.sh
   ```
   Initializes Terraform backends, enables required GCP services, configures Workload Identity Federation, and offers applies per environment.
3. **Configure GitHub environments**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/configure-github-env.sh staging
   ./scripts/configure-github-env.sh prod
   ```
   Populates GitHub environment secrets/variables (e.g., WIF provider, Artifact Registry, GKE cluster metadata) from Terraform outputs.

### Local Development

Use pnpm filters to target the web application:

- **Run the web app**
  ```bash
  pnpm --filter @ai-dev-platform/web dev
  ```
- **Linting and type checking**
  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  pnpm type-check
  ```
- **Testing**
  ```bash
  # Unit tests
  pnpm --filter @ai-dev-platform/web test
  # E2E tests (Playwright starts a dev server when E2E_TARGET_URL is unset)
  pnpm --filter @ai-dev-platform/web test:e2e
  ```
- **Build the application**
  ```bash
  pnpm --filter @ai-dev-platform/web build
  ```

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions enforces quality and security before any deployment.

1. **Continuous Integration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)**
   - Security scans: Gitleaks and Semgrep.
   - Quality gates: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, lint, type-check, unit tests, build, format check.
   - Supply chain: build container, scan (Trivy/Grype), generate SBOM (Syft), sign (Cosign).
2. **Deployment (`deploy-staging.yml`, `deploy-production.yml`)**
   - Authenticates to GCP via Workload Identity Federation.
   - Rebuilds and signs the image, pushes to Artifact Registry, resolves the immutable digest.
   - Patches Kustomize overlays with the digest and Workload Identity annotation, applies manifests to GKE, waits for rollout.
   - Runs Playwright E2E tests against the live Gateway endpoint (staging always; production workflows can be extended similarly).

## Supply Chain Security

The platform applies rigorous supply-chain controls to preserve artifact integrity:

1. **Scanning:** Trivy and Grype run during CI and fail the pipeline on High/Critical (Trivy) or High (Grype) findings.
2. **SBOM generation:** Syft produces CycloneDX SBOMs that are uploaded as workflow artifacts.
3. **Keyless signing:** Cosign uses GitHub Actions OIDC (via WIF) to sign images and attest the SBOM with no long-lived keys.
4. **Binary Authorization:** GKE Autopilot clusters enforce Binary Authorization, allowing only signed and attested images to run.
5. **Immutable images:** Deployment workflows resolve tags to immutable digests and patch Kustomize overlays before applying manifests.

Developers can run the same steps locally with:

```bash
./scripts/container/supply-chain.sh build
./scripts/container/supply-chain.sh scan
./scripts/container/supply-chain.sh sbom
./scripts/container/supply-chain.sh sign
```

## Development Workflow

This project enforces a consistent workflow to maintain quality, security, and reproducibility:

1. **Branching:** Create feature branches from `main`; never commit directly to protected branches.
2. **Commits:** Follow Conventional Commits (`commitlint` enforces format).
3. **Pre-commit hooks:** Husky runs `gitleaks protect --staged` and `lint-staged` (ESLint + Prettier) on staged files.
4. **Pre-push hooks:** Verify editor extension lock consistency and capture git sync status.
5. **Pull requests:** Use the helper script to validate, push, and open PRs with auto-merge enabled:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/push-pr.sh
   ```
6. **Monitor merges:** Track PR status until merge (or failure) to ensure required checks pass:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitor-pr.sh
   ```
7. **Editor extensions:** Keep AI assistant extensions aligned across contributors:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/update-editor-extensions.sh
   ./scripts/verify-editor-extensions.sh --strict
   ```
   Commit changes to `config/editor-extensions.lock.json` whenever versions differ.

## Resetting / Uninstalling

To wipe generated state (caches, node_modules, extension locks) run:

```bash
./scripts/uninstall.sh --force --include-home
```

Add `--destroy-cloud` to tear down Terraform-managed infrastructure (ensure you have credentials and intend to remove cloud resources).
